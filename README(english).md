Compared with the traditional industry, the IT industry develops and updates faster. Once you stop learning, it will soon be eliminated by the industry. However, we must be clear: only those who are junior-level practitioners and those with excellent technology will be eliminated. It is always scarce. So for learning, we still have to be down-to-earth.

The same is true for self-learning Python. Do nâ€™t keep collecting various information websites, buying various books, downloading a large number of teaching videos because of a fever in the beginning. , And finally completed the learning course-"From Intro to Giving Up". Therefore, learning Python requires one step at a time, to learn practically.

FQ
Before I talk about how to get started with Python, I personally recommend that everyone has their own FQ tool, use Google search, take a look at the world outside the wall, and look at open source projects on Github.

As for how to FQ, here are the tools I have used: FQ toolset

Python learning resource set
I believe that many people will find various learning materials when learning a programming language. To be honest, there are too many materials, but they are useless. According to your learning habits, you can choose a resource and stick to it.

Because everyone's needs are different, here is a collection of good Python learning materials:

Python blog website resources
There are also some interesting websites:

A website where you can see the execution process
Getting started with Python
For getting started, it is mainly to master the basic grammar and familiar with the programming specifications, so most of the tutorials are basically the same, so it is recommended to choose a tutorial that suits you and stick to it.

In the introduction to Python, I have written a series of "Grassroots Python" articles, which are based on Python 3.6 series of Python introductory tutorials. For better reading, I have organized it on GitBook . .

Note: On February 27, 2018, the basic knowledge introduction part was completed. Recently, some readers reported that some pictures could not be opened (the pictures were placed in Qiniuyun before, using a temporary link. Recently Qiniuyun turned this off, resulting in the picture not being able to be opened), and he was somewhat disappointed with the previous content Satisfied, I decided to make another revision starting July 7, 2019. But here is a note, because I used to write a windows computer before, and now use mac, so some examples are screenshots of windows, some are screenshots of mac, don't feel strange.

Django
There are many different web frameworks under Python. Django is the most representative of the heavyweight players. Many successful websites and apps are based on Django.

If you have a little information about your basic children's shoes, you can try to get started through a series of tutorials from the Django blog to build to deployment abroad . This tutorial is very detailed and there are many interesting pictures. However, because of the wall, many people will not be able to visit it. Even if they do, they will not be patient in reading and learning because they are in English. So I plan to translate this tutorial.

A complete beginner's guide to Django-part1
A complete beginner's guide to Django-part2
Later, a friend said that this tutorial has already been translated, so I will not translate it, but I feel that my translation is still very good, because it is not a literal translation, it is expressed again in my own language after understanding.

Here are the top translate this tutorial program Github and blog , to see which feel comfortable, you choose which to learn.

Continually updated....
